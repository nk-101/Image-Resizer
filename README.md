# Image-Resizer
This project is a Python script that resizes an image to a specified percentage of its original dimensions using the OpenCV library.

Features:
Reads an input image file and resizes it based on a configurable scaling percentage.
Outputs the resized image with a user-specified filename.
Supports resizing while maintaining the original aspect ratio.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
OpenCV library (pip install opencv-python)

How to Use:
Copy and paste the image file you want to resize into the project folder.
Update the source variable with the input image's filename (e.g., "harry.jpg").
Update the destination variable with the desired output filename (e.g., "newImage.jpeg").
Set the desired scaling percentage using the scale_percent variable (default is 50%).
Run the script to generate the resized image.

How to Run:
Ensure the input image is in the project folder.
Modify the script's parameters (source, destination, and scale_percent) as needed.
Execute the script to create the resized image.

Example:
If the input image is harry.jpg and the scaling percentage is set to 50, the script will resize the image to 50% of its original dimensions and save it as newImage.jpeg.
